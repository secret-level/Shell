# SharpKeys Registry Settings

Edits the windows registry to remap/disable some nasty key combos (Alt + Tab, Alt + f4) and make AltGr (LCtrl + RAlt) reachable. As Windows itself lacks the settings to disable its own hotkeys, use Microsoft PowerToys to remap (LCtrl + RAlt + Esc): Esc.

## SharpKeys Remaps

```sh
f4: disable
LCtrl: RAlt
Tab: \
```

# d2rename.sh

A shell script to rename d2 .jpg files in ascending order.
